# Tic-Tac-Toe

1. The game should let the players know who's turn it is.
2. Game tiles should only be clickable once, and if the game is over they should not be clickable at all.
3. The game should display who wins the game if someone wins, otherwise, say that the game resulted in a tie.
4. There should be a Restart Game button that does not refresh the page (set state).
5. Use the symbols X and O.
6. On each playerâ€™s turn, that player places one of their symbols on an unoccupied space by clicking.
7. The game continues until one player places three symbols in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and wins or there are no remaining available spaces and it is a draw.
8. Only have a single `<div id="app"></div> `in your index.HTML (try to code golf the HTML file)

## PseudoCode

### State & Var for tic-tac-toe

Two players are needed
```
Player X
Player O
```
Who goes first and which turn is it.
By default X will go first.

A function can be added later to randomly determain who goes first.
A function can be added later if you wish to play with a real person or AI

Ex:
```
playerTurn: "X" or "O"
```
How do we keep track of the tic-tac-toe board?
A tic-tac-toe board as 9 sections `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,]` that can be 3 different states.
`NONE '', X, or O`

Ex: 
```
boardState: ['',X,O,'','','','','',X]
```
winCondition, These are the conditions that will be need either by X or O inorder for the game to be over and for there to be a winner.

3 of X or O in a row will signal a winner.
If neither a TIE function should inform the USER
Ex:

```
winCondition: 
    3 left to right
    3 top to bottom
    3 dia from left to right or right to left

```

## Functions

List of functions that need to be defined inorder to make the program work based on user input and state. User input will be recorded and functions will react to state. Using User as trigger after a submit/ CTA`(call to action)`

- checkCondition()
    > After every change of state, check wether player X or O has won.
     if not check if the tic-tac-toe board is full which would equal a tie ending the game.
- changePlayer()
    > After every turn allow the other player to move. Change state of who's turn it is `playerTurn`
- gameResult()
    > Should display the result after a game has been determained to be over based on `checkCondition` reading the state.
- drawBoard()
    > init() OR refreshing of the board. Reload the current state of the tic-tac-toe board.
- setState()
    > set the default or new state of the tic-tac-toe board
- handleClick()
    > ON init() RUN `click event` for every box on tic-tac-toe board. Manage the `click events` for all boxes that have the state of `'None'/ ''`IF a state does not equal `None` then remove `click event`. 
- updateTitle()
    > Depending on the state of `playerTurn` set box that is clicked to state of `playerTurn` and update state to reflect the new state of the board.
- finishGame()
    > When `gameResult` is reached set Dom to give user an option to reset the board. PLAY AGAIN? Create `click event` for `resetGame()`
- resetGame()
    > When button `clicked` reset DOM and state to default RUN `drawBoard()`

# Sandbox Pseudocode
We will sandbox the first part of our tic-tac-toe program. The goal with the sandbox to iron out the logic of playing tic-tac-toe and create a functional winCondition/ Condition in our sandbox.

1. How to write a tic-tac-toe console.log javascript
2. How to manange state
3. How to find and determain winCondition of the board
4. How to change state/ Update state after CTA
5. How to Reset State

## State

2. How to manange state
We can manage state with and object, then added another Object within to mangage our default values for state. 

Check currentBoard and playerTurn state. What are the winning combos in the currentBoard array? Array [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].
Winning Combos Indexes that are the same.
['X','X','X'] 
### Indexes
---
#### ROW
[0,1,2] 

[3,4,5]

[6,7,8]

---
#### COL
[0,3,6]

[1,4,7]

[2,5,8]

---
#### DIAGONAL
[0,4,8]

[2,4,6]

---
```
const tic = {

    default = {
        playerTurn: 'X';
        currentBoard: ['','','','','','','','',''];
        winCondition: [
                    [0,1,2], 
                    [3,4,5],
                    [6,7,8],
                    [0,3,6],
                    [1,4,7],
                    [2,5,8],
                    [0,4,8],
                    [2,4,6],
                    ];

    }
    current = {
        playerTurn: 'X' or 'O';
        currentBoard: ['X','X','O','','','','','',''];
        winCondition: [
                [0,1,2], 
                [3,4,5],
                [6,7,8],
                [0,3,6],
                [1,4,7],
                [2,5,8],
                [0,4,8],
                [2,4,6],
                ]    
    }

}


```

3. How to find and determain winCondition of the board


Func checkWinConditions() 
```
function checkBoard(){
    for (const i in tic.winConditions){
        for (const ii in tic.winConditions[i]){
            let array = [];
            for (const iii of tic.winConditions[i][ii]){
                array.push(tic.current.currentBoard[iii])
            }
        
            if (array.every((x) => x === 'X')){
                return array.every((x) => x === 'X')
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

4. How to change state/ Update state after CTA

- Param boxNum Must be a int whole number, the length of currenBoard array values between (0-8)
- TO-DO disable button on click Creating UI

```

function UpdateState(boxNum){
    
    if (tic.current.currentBoard[boxNum] == ''){
        tic.current.currentBoard[boxNum] = tic.current.playerTurn
        if (tic.current.playerTurn == 'X'){
            tic.current.playerTurn = 'O'
        } else if (tic.current.playerTurn == 'O') {
            tic.current.playerTurn = 'X'
        }
    } else {
        console.log(`Cant place ${tic.current.playerTurn} Here`)
    }

}

```

5. How to Reset State

// Resets State of Obj 
// Issue Resolved 
//https://www.sitepoint.com/variable-assignment-mutation-javascript/
```
function resetState() {
tic.current = { ...tic.default }
}

```

---
---
## UI interface 

### To-Do
- Starting with a basic html webpage 
- Added Bootstrap CDL
- Create headerdiv for title, playerTurn, resetButton
```
div header
    div title = "tic-tac-toe"
    div playerTurn = playerTurn state
    div resetButton // show at end of a game, winner loser or tie
```

- Create Board div, 9x cols matching currentBoard states
- refresh every updateState() function
- Disable div/ click event when state of currentBoard[div#] not equal to ""
- assign bootstrap class of "col-4" to all sub-divs in currentBoard Div
```
div currentBoard
    div 0
    div 1
    div 2
    div 3
    div 4
    div 5
    div 6
    div 7
    div 8
```
---

### click event listener

- We will need to pass the html id of our newly created div
- In the same funtions that loops to create our html elements 
- insert createEvent(div) after the element is assigned its html id
- When div is clicked trigger divClicked() fun 
- get Id of element that was clicked, RUN removeEvent passing id
- 

```
//pass param id of element

func createEvent(div) 
    const divClick = document.getElementbyId(div)
    divClick.addEvertListener('click', divClicked)

func removeEvent(div)
    const divClick = document.getElementbyId(div)
    divClick.removeEvent()

func divClicked(){
    get id of element clicked
    Run functions to Update State, DOM, remove click Event
    For now console.log(`element Name ${div#} pressed!`)
}

```
---

### Putting it all together

Now that our helper functions are created and our console.log version of tic-tac-toe is working as well as our bootstrap UI.
We can begin to prep our functions to merge into our tic-tac-toe program.
We have state manager functions, and user input/ Bootstrap Dom functions.
We can start by assigning values of pageContent to our state obj
We want the Dom data to be dependent upon our state 
Only to have the click event to trigger the Update of state and return html id info.
